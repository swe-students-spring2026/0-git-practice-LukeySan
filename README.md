# An Intersting Article About Learning System Design

[The Hard Way to Learn System Design (And Why It Works)](https://medium.com/@eeshmidha80/the-hard-way-to-learn-system-design-and-why-it-works-ea5337f3d407), by Medium User Eeshmidha

This article was about a person’s experience learning system design. The author first mentions how his initial approach was the same one he used to learn other parts of software engineering. For example, reading documentation and articles, watching YouTube videos, and working on personal projects. But one realization he made was that learning system design isn’t the same as learning a language or a framework. Building a project “with system design in mind” isn’t always enough; it has to be the kind of project where things genuinely break down if the system isn’t efficient and reliable. Reading this made me realize that’s something I overlooked too when thinking about what to build to practice my skills.

# Comment About the Article

I liked that the article mentioned how diagrams can give the illusion of understanding. I think this challege is relevant to many concepts in computer science, and as the author mentioned, I feel I have had to learn the hard way that passive learning and tutorials don't work. Slow learning is something this author emphasizes and I agree that it is sometimes the only way.
